# scrambler

[**scrambler**](https://github.com/anish1992/scrambler/) made with C++ and Java.

I Wrote a C++ and Java program, which manipulates text file using iostream and system commands, to scramble the text of the text file depending on a passphrase set by the user. The text file could only descramble with the passphrase, which the user had set. There's also a Java GUI that would run the scrambler.  This project was a pet project that I did because after my CSC 340 class I wanted to explore more with system commands c++ and java. Then, I ended up making iterative updates and using it on my computer.
